                     Package "Log::Declare" Version 0.02
                =============================================


Abstract:
---------

This package provides a highly efficient logger which benefits from
an almost zero performance cost on log statements when logging
categories or namespaces are disabled.

It also provides a way of logging variables through Data::Dumper
without actually importing Data::Dumper into your packages.
